title: "Fast One-class Classification using Class Boundary-preserving Random Projections"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/frocc
excerpt: 'We develop a novel fast one-class classifier called FROCC. We generate a large number of random directions, and project each point from the training set onto these directions. Along each direction, we group "nearby" projections into intervals. Given a test point, we score it as an inlier or outlier based on the proportion of directions along which it lies in an interval.'

We develop a novel fast one-class classifier called FROCC. We generate a large number of random directions, and project each point from the training set onto these directions. Along each direction, we group "nearby" projections into intervals. Given a test point, we score it as an inlier or outlier based on the proportion of directions along which it lies in an interval.
