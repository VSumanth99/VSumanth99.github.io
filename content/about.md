I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute, UC San Diego.  I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home).

My focus is on developing AI systems that understand and reason about the physical world, with a focus on **causal discovery**, **representation learning**, and **agentic intelligence** for scientific applications. My current work involves building autonomous agents that can plan and use tools to solve complex problems in **weather and climate science** and **provably-correct mathematics**. I have also worked on causal discovery and representation learning, developing identifiable models for **mixture distributions** and for **spatiotemporal data**.
