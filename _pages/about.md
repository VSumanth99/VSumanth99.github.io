Welcome to my website!
======

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at the University of California, San Diego. I am fortunate enough to be a part of the Rose Spatio-Temporal Lab, headed by the excellent [Prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). My research interests include spatio-temporal modeling and causal inference.

In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Sivananthan Sampath]() on the conjugate gradient method with general source conditions, [Prof. Sven Koenig]() and [Prof. Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) (then Ph.D. candidate) on Multi-Agent Path-Finding, [Prof. Srikanta Bedathur]() and [Prof. Amitabha Bagchi]() on Fast One-Class Classifiers, and [Prof. Prathosh AP]() on Domain Generalization.
