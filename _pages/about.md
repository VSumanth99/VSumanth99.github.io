Welcome to my website!
======

I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at the University of California, San Diego. I am fortunate enough to be jointly advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Prof. Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home). My research interests include spatio-temporal modeling and causal inference.

In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Sivananthan Sampath](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~siva/) on the conjugate gradient method with general source conditions, [Prof. Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/) and [Prof. Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) (then Ph.D. candidate) on Multi-Agent Path-Finding, [Prof. Srikanta Bedathur](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/) and [Prof. Amitabha Bagchi](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~bagchi/) on Fast One-Class Classifiers, and [Prof. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0) on Domain Generalization.
